This project is for the automation of the PO ordering system for Anteater Electric Racing.

In order to reduce work for team leads and project managers, the PO ordering system is being implemented in order to reduce overhead, centralize all PO processing, and improve the efficiency of ordering parts. This will be all handled through Google's APIs, namely the Google Sheets, Google Forms, and Gmail APIs.
